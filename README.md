## Welcome! 
- 👋 I’m Keith - Founder of 🐋 WhaleLogic  <em>"Engineering intelligent, cloud-native systems and software solutions for autonomous decision-making, smart home capabilities and next-generation information capture." </em>🐳 
- I'm interested in building cloud-native microservices, Data pipelines and reliable REST API's. Recently, I began exploring GraphQL and Protobuf.
- Lately I've started matching Algorithms and ML Models to particular use cases. I plan on building and sharing a trained model on HuggingFace/dontslamthedoor.
- I design and implement efficient, broad use-case cloud solutions for small businesses and start-ups.
