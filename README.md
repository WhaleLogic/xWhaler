## Welcome to the 🐳 WhaleLogic Repo!
- 👋 I’m Keith - A Cloud Solutions Architect, Programmer, military veteran and Founder of  <b>WhaleLogic</b> 🐋 An IT Services company.

  
- I'm interested in building cloud-native microservices, Data pipelines and reliable REST API's. Recently, I began exploring GraphQL and Protobuf.
- Lately I've began matching datasets and ML models and algorithms for particular use cases. I plan on sharing a trained model soon on HuggingFace.co/dontslamthedoor.


### 🐋 WhaleLogic 〰️ designs, installs and administers a variety of efficient and reliable cloud solutions for smart homes, small businesses, and start-ups. These software and hardware solutions process data and network traffic in a private, reliable way and lets users easily control their own data. 

#### Services include browser-based 24/7 camera feeds with no subscription, smart sensor lighting, and smart home device setup. All data stays on-premises, with NAS storage for video and AI-powered alerts like object detection.
